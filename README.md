ðŸ”¹ **Title:** Identity-Based Authentication & User Management in MVC  
This section of the project handles **user registration, login, and logout** utilizing **ASP.NET Identity**, providing a secure and structured authentication system. Users can create accounts, log in securely, and manage their sessions efficiently.  

ðŸ“Œ **Key Features:**  
âœ… **User Registration** with robust validation and encrypted password storage  
âœ… **Secure Login** utilizing Identity authentication mechanisms  
âœ… **Role-Based Access Control** to manage different user permissions  
âœ… **Cookie-Based Authentication** for persistent user sessions  

ðŸš€ **Note:** While this implementation is optimized for educational purposes, real-world applications should incorporate additional **security measures** such as **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** to further enhance protection.
